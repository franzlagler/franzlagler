I'm a web developer with a passion for all frontend-related aspects. In particular, I'm an advocate of **user-centered designs** and **A11y**: Let's make these things what they are supposed to be - an integral part of building applications. And let's convince those in doubt about it.

Definitely always up to learn something new in my profession. Whether it's by simply reading through a documentary online, being confronted with a complex challenge at work or by talking to other fellow developers and listening to their stories.
