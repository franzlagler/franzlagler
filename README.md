Hi, my name is Franz. I'm a Web Devloper living in lovely Vienna, Austria. :austria: :eu:

## My Focus

I'm passionate about frontend, UX and accessiblity. That is, I love building applications that don't just 'work' but that all people regardless of their background also love to use.

## Background

I hold a degree in philosophy and worked in several areas such as IT Management and politics.

During the pandemic, I decided to reorient myself professionally. Always having had a thing for computers - I would install Ubuntu on my PC when I was 11 - I decided to look for oportunities to get into software engineering. After having done some research, I ended up doing a small introductory Web Development course. What can I say - it was an instant match. I loved everything about it and finished it in no time. Yet I knew I was still far away from being in a position where I could apply for a job.   

That's why I decided to enroll for a full-time Web Development Bootcamp by [UpLeveled GmbH](https://upleveled.io/) here in Vienna. After five months of hard work and a lot of error messages, I can now confidently say that I have what it takes to land my first job as a developer.
