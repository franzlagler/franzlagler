## Strengths

- Problem-Solving (breaking down a big problem into many small problems)
- Eye for clean, appealing designs
- Skilled at googling
- Team player (I can work well with different personality types)
- Growth Mindset

## Background

I hold a degree in philosophy and worked in several areas such as IT Management and politics.

During the pandemic, I decided to reorient myself professionally. Always having had a thing for computers - I would install Ubuntu on my PC when I was 11 - I decided to look for oportunities to get into software engineering. After having done some research, I ended up doing a small introductory Web Development course. What can I say - it was an instant match. I loved everything about it and finished it in no time. Yet I knew I was still far away from being in a position where I could apply for a job.   

That's why I decided to enroll for a full-time Web Development Bootcamp by [UpLeveled GmbH](https://upleveled.io/) here in Vienna. After five months of hard work and a lot of error messages, I can now confidently say that I have what it takes to land my first job as a developer.
