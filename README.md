I'm a **web developer** with a passion for everything frontend-related. In particular, I'm interested in accessibility. Despite the increasing awareness of the importance of accessibility in recent years, way too many people still consider it just some nice-to-have-feature. Let's change that together and convince people that accessibility pays off in a lot of ways - also from a monetary point of view.

Always up to learn something new. Whether by simply reading through a documentary, being confronted with a new challenge at work or by meeting fellow developers and listening to their stories.
